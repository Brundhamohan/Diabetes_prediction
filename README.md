Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over an extended period. Common symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, and even death. Long-term complications can involve cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. The dataset consists of females who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage.

Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether a patient in the dataset has diabetes or not, based on their medical information.

Dataset Details
The dataset includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable: Outcome. The predictor variables consist of the following:

Pregnancies: The number of times the patient has been pregnant.
BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient.
Insulin: Insulin level of the patient.
Age: Age of the patient.
And other medical measurements.
Methodology
Model Selection: We employed the XGBoost algorithm for this project, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for handling complex interactions and large datasets efficiently.

Hyperparameter Optimization: The model underwent hyperparameter tuning to improve its performance, ensuring that it achieved the best possible results for prediction accuracy.

Result
The optimized XGBoost model achieved a Cross Validation Score of 0.81, making it the most reliable model for predicting diabetes based on the dataset's variables.

Conclusion
The model developed using XGBoost demonstrated excellent performance, with a high degree of accuracy, helping predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The cross-validation score indicates strong generalization ability, which suggests that the model could be useful for early detection of diabetes in clinical settings.

This model serves as a potential tool for healthcare professionals to make better-informed decisions regarding diabetes diagnosis and treatment.
